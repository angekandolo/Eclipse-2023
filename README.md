For the Capstone project,

Hello, 

This a general Spring boot application for an anime content website.

Some notes:
For any of the commentbox features on the webpage. You must go to the site and create a new project for your site so that you can view or remove comments.

For the email properties in the application properties file. be sure to get the necessary details through the Google website. 
you can create a new account, go into settings, enable 2- step verification, and then generate an app password. 


The template used for the webpages are from: https://freehtml5.co/closest-free-html5-bootstrap-template/

A MYSQL database was also used for this project. please connect the database that you are using by changing the information in application.properties.

There will be an ER diagram attached so it shows the relationships of the tables created.
(there is probably a file that is not needed called admin.html)


Have fun coding.
